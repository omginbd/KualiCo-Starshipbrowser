# Star Wars API Viewer


## What you are building
Your task, dear friend, is to build an application using the [Star Wars
API](http://swapi.co/).

The application is a starship sales site. We need to be able to search for
starships, sort them by cost, and filter them by cost (if we have a starship
budget we don't want to look at ships above it.)

If there are pilots associated with the starship, we want to get more
information about them as well, because we are concerned about previous owners.

The main features of the app are:

1. See a list of all starships
2. Filter list by price
3. Sort list by price
4. Search list
5. See individual starship
6. See info on pilots attached to individual starships

Please ask if you have any questions about the requirements. The project is
deliberately open-ended because we want to see how you build it.

Your end result should be a bunch of code we can look at and run. If you use
version control that is publicly available (like GitHub), a link to a
repository is perfect. If not, just sending us a directory is fine as well.

We want to be able to run the app ourselves, so please include instructions
for running it that a smart developer who might not be familiar with your tech
stack could follow.

## Examples of using the API

You can get a list of all starships by making an HTTP request to
[http://swapi.co/api/starships/](http://swapi.co/api/starships/). The list
should look something like this:

```JavaScript
{
  "count": 36,
  "next": "http://swapi.co/api/starships/?page=2",
  "previous": null,
  "results": [
    {
      "name": "Sentinel-class landing craft",
      "model": "Sentinel-class landing craft",
      "manufacturer": "Sienar Fleet Systems, Cyngus Spaceworks",
      "cost_in_credits": "240000",
      "length": "38",
      "max_atmosphering_speed": "1000",
      "crew": "5",
      "passengers": "75",
      "cargo_capacity": "180000",
      "consumables": "1 month",
      "hyperdrive_rating": "1.0",
      "MGLT": "70",
      "starship_class": "landing craft",
      "pilots": [],
      "films": [
        "http://swapi.co/api/films/1/"
      ],
      "created": "2014-12-10T15:48:00.586000Z",
      "edited": "2014-12-22T17:35:44.431407Z",
      "url": "http://swapi.co/api/starships/5/"
    },
    // a bunch more stuff here
  ]
}
```

You can get info for a pilot by making an HTTP request to
http://swapi.co/api/people/:id.
[http://swapi.co/api/people/13/](http://swapi.co/api/people/13/) returns info
on Chewbacca.


## What we're looking for

You can use whatever tech stack, rendering platform and architectural style you
want. Web apps are most common, but you could make a robot, a terminal
application, a mobile app, or a series of moving impressionist paintings.

The *only* constraint is that you use [git](http://git-scm.com/) to keep track
of your code. If you aren't familiar with git,
[this](http://www.sitepoint.com/git-for-beginners/) is a decent guide. If you
really can't figure it out, ask us for help.

We will evaluate the code on correctness (Does it work without bugs or errors),
completeness (Does it do everything we said it should do?), and code quality
(Can we read and understand the code? Is it easy to modify?).

## How to start, and how to end

* Start with an empty commit

  Start the project with a git commit that's just a `Readme.md` file. It
  doesn't matter what's inside, we just want to know when you started work on
  the project.

* Commit as you go

  We'd like to see your git habits! We're also interested in seeing how your
  code evolves as you work.

* Zip it up, mail it in

  When you're done, zip up the whole repo and send it to us by
  messenger-tortoise. If messenger-tortoises are not available, email is also
  an option.

## If you get stuck

1. Check the [Star Wars API documentation](http://swapi.co/documentation)
2. Check the googles
3. Ask us. We won't deduct points for asking questions or for clarification. In
   the real world you get to ask questions too!


## Only submit your own work

Please don't take someone else's code and represent it as your own. You can use
libraries and frameworks, but make sure you wrote the application code.


## Feedback

We are iterating on this all the time. If you have feedback, please let us
know what could be better.
